**offers** | [**\Swagger\Client\Model\EbayOfferDetailsWithAll[]**](EbayOfferDetailsWithAll.md) | This container is an array of one or more of the seller&#x27;s offers for the SKU value that is passed in through the required &lt;strong&gt;sku&lt;/strong&gt; query parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class&#x3D;\&quot;tablenote\&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, the Inventory API does not support the same SKU across multiple eBay marketplaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Occurs:&lt;/strong&gt; 25 | [optional]

**size** | **int** | This integer value indicates the number of offers being displayed on the current page of results.

**total** | **int** | This integer value is the total number of offers that exist for the specified SKU value.

If this is the case, &lt;b&gt;getOffers&lt;/b&gt; will return two offers, so this value would be &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, only one offer will be returned and this value will be &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; | [optional]
